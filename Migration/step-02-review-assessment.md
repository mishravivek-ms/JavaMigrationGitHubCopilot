| Code migration (JDK, Spring, packages) | 8-16 hours |
| Configuration updates | 2-4 hours |
| Testing and validation | 4-8 hours |
| Azure deployment setup | 4-6 hours |
| Documentation | 2-3 hours |
| **Total** | **20-37 hours** |

### Validation Questions

1. **Realistic?** Does this match your team's experience?
2. **Risk buffer?** Is there contingency time?
3. **Dependencies?** Are external dependencies accounted for?

### Adjusting Estimates

If estimates seem off, comment:

```markdown
@copilot Your estimate of 8-16 hours for code migration seems low given:
- We have 50+ Java classes
- Multiple legacy patterns to update
- Need to migrate 3 configuration files

Can you provide a more detailed breakdown by component?
```

## 4️⃣ Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas

Copilot should identify risks like:

🔴 **High Risk**:
- Scheduled task timing accuracy (business critical)
- Database schema changes (Hibernate 4 → 6)
- Package namespace changes (javax → jakarta)

🟡 **Medium Risk**:
- Date/time API migration (data format changes)
- Logging framework transition
- HTTP client updates (RestTemplate → WebClient)

🟢 **Low Risk**:
- Configuration format changes (XML → Java)
- Dependency version updates
- Code style improvements

### Mitigation Strategies

For each high-risk area, Copilot should suggest:

- **Testing approach**: Unit tests, integration tests
- **Rollback plan**: How to revert if issues arise
- **Validation criteria**: How to verify success

### Example Risk Analysis

```markdown
**Risk**: Scheduled task not running every minute in Azure

**Impact**: High (business critical requirement)

**Mitigation**:
1. Test with Azure Functions Timer Trigger locally
2. Monitor execution logs in Azure
3. Set up alerting for missed executions
4. Consider redundancy (backup scheduling mechanism)
```

## 5️⃣ Code Examples Review

### What to Expect

Copilot should provide before/after examples:

#### Example: Package Migration

**Before (javax)**:
```java
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import javax.validation.constraints.NotNull;
```

**After (jakarta)**:
```java
import jakarta.persistence.Entity;
import jakarta.persistence.Id;
import jakarta.validation.constraints.NotNull;
```

#### Example: Date API Migration

**Before (java.util.Date)**:
```java
private Date createdDate;

@PrePersist
protected void onCreate() {
    createdDate = new Date();
}
```

**After (java.time)**:
```java
private LocalDateTime createdDate;

@PrePersist
protected void onCreate() {
    createdDate = LocalDateTime.now();
}
```

### Validation

Check that examples:
- ✅ Are accurate and complete
- ✅ Show both before and after
