## 📝 Creating the Assessment Issue

### Step 1.1: Navigate to Your Repository

1. Go to your GitHub repository containing the legacy application
2. Click on the **"Issues"** tab
3. Click **"New Issue"**

### Step 1.2: Create the Issue

**Title**: `Application Migration Assessment - Spring Boot 2.7.x to Spring Boot 3.x`

**Description**: Use the template below (customize as needed)

```markdown
@copilot Please provide a comprehensive assessment for migrating this legacy Java application to modern technologies.

## Current State

### Technology Stack
- **JDK**: 1.8 (released 2014, compiled with 1.8 target)
- **Spring Boot**: 2.7.18 (last 2.x version, released 2023)
- **Spring Framework**: 5.3.31 (bundled with Spring Boot 2.7)
- **Hibernate**: 5.6.15.Final (bundled with Spring Boot 2.7)
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **Packaging**: JAR (executable with embedded Tomcat)
- **Database**: H2 in-memory
- **Logging**: Log4j 1.2.17 (deprecated, should use SLF4J)

### Application Components
1. **REST API** (`MessageController`)
   - CRUD operations for messages
   - Endpoints: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE at `/api/messages`
   - Uses `javax.servlet.*` and `javax.validation.*` packages
   - Legacy `@Controller` with `@ResponseBody` (should use `@RestController`)

2. **Scheduled Task** (`MessageScheduledTask`)
   - **CRITICAL**: Must run every 60 seconds (every minute)
   - Reports message statistics
   - Uses `@Scheduled(fixedDelay = 60000)`

3. **Data Layer**
   - JPA 2.2 with `javax.persistence.*`
   - Spring Data JPA 2.x
   - H2 in-memory database
   - Hibernate 5.6.x as ORM

4. **Configuration**
   - Spring Boot 2.7.x with `application.properties`
   - `@SpringBootApplication` main class
   - Auto-configuration enabled

### Known Legacy Patterns
- Field injection instead of constructor injection
- `java.util.Date` and `Calendar` instead of `java.time`
- `SimpleDateFormat` (not thread-safe)
- Log4j 1.x (deprecated)
- Commons Lang 2.x (deprecated)
- Deprecated primitive wrapper constructors (`new Boolean()`, `new Integer()`)
- `finalize()` methods
- `@Controller` + `@ResponseBody` instead of `@RestController`
- Old-style `@RequestMapping` with `method` parameter

## Migration Goals

### Target State
- **JDK**: 17 LTS (or 21 LTS)
- **Spring Boot**: 3.x (latest stable, includes Spring Framework 6.x)
- **Packages**: jakarta.* namespace (Jakarta EE 9+)
- **Deployment**: Azure App Service
- **Logging**: SLF4J with Logback (Spring Boot default)
- **Best Practices**: Constructor injection, modern APIs, @RestController

### Requirements
1. ✅ Preserve all existing functionality
2. ✅ Scheduled task MUST run every minute (critical business requirement)
3. ✅ Maintain H2 in-memory database (for workshop simplicity)
4. ✅ Deploy to Azure cloud
5. ✅ Follow Spring Boot 3.x best practices
6. ✅ Update to modern Java APIs (java.time, etc.)
7. ✅ Use Azure Developer CLI (azd) for streamlined deployment

## Assessment Requests

Please provide:

### 1. Migration Analysis
- List all breaking changes from Spring Boot 2.7 → 3.x
- Identify JDK 1.8 → 17 compatibility issues
- Document javax.* → jakarta.* namespace changes required
- Highlight deprecated API usage that must be updated
- Analyze impact of Spring Framework 5.x → 6.x changes

### 2. Azure Deployment Options
Compare at least **3 different Azure deployment approaches**:

For each option, provide:
- Azure service(s) used
- How the REST API would be hosted
- How the scheduled task would be implemented
- Pros and cons
- Cost considerations (relative: $, $$, $$$)
- Complexity level (Simple, Moderate, Complex)
- Best use case

Example options to consider:
- Azure App Service (recommended for simplicity)
- Azure Container Apps (if containerization preferred)
- Azure Spring Apps (Spring-optimized platform)
- Azure Functions (serverless approach)
- AKS (for complex orchestration needs)

### 3. Recommended Approach
Based on the analysis:
- Which Azure option do you recommend and why?
- What is the migration effort (hours/days)?
- What are the highest risk areas?
- Suggested migration order/phases

### 4. Code Change Examples
Provide before/after examples for:
- Dependency changes (`pom.xml` - Spring Boot 2.7 → 3.x parent)
- Package imports (javax → jakarta)
- Date API usage (Date → LocalDateTime)
- Controller patterns (@Controller + @ResponseBody → @RestController)
- RequestMapping (@RequestMapping(method=...) → @GetMapping/@PostMapping)
- Logging (Log4j → SLF4J)

## Deliverables

Please include in your response:
- [ ] Detailed migration analysis
- [ ] Comparison table of Azure options
- [ ] Recommended approach with justification
- [ ] Estimated effort and timeline

### Step 1.3: Submit the Issue

1. Review your issue for completeness
2. Click **"Submit new issue"**
3. Wait for Copilot to respond (typically 5-15 minutes)

## 💡 Understanding the Prompt Structure

Let's break down why this prompt is effective:

### Section 1: Current State
```markdown
### Technology Stack
- **JDK**: 1.8 (released 2014)
- **Spring Framework**: 4.3.30.RELEASE (legacy, not Spring Boot)
...
```

**Why**: Provides complete context about where we're starting from. Copilot needs this to understand the gap between current and target state.

### Section 2: Application Components
```markdown
2. **Scheduled Task** (`MessageScheduledTask`)
   - **CRITICAL**: Must run every 60 seconds (every minute)
```

**Why**: Highlights critical business requirements. The "CRITICAL" marker ensures Copilot prioritizes this in its recommendations.

### Section 3: Known Legacy Patterns
```markdown
- Field injection instead of constructor injection
- `java.util.Date` and `Calendar` instead of `java.time`
```

**Why**: Explicitly lists technical debt. This helps Copilot identify areas that need modernization beyond just version upgrades.

### Section 4: Assessment Requests
```markdown
Compare at least **3 different Azure deployment approaches**:

For each option, provide:
