# Step 3: Create Migration Issue

**Duration**: 10 minutes (+ Copilot processing time: 15-30 minutes)

## 🎯 Objectives

- Create an issue requesting Copilot to implement the migration
- Provide clear instructions and requirements
- Reference the assessment from Step 2
- Specify the chosen Azure deployment approach

## 📋 Prerequisites

- [ ] Completed Step 2: Review Assessment
- [ ] Chosen Azure deployment approach
- [ ] Understanding of migration requirements
- [ ] Assessment issue number handy for reference

## 🚀 Task Overview

In this step, Copilot will:
1. Implement the migration across all files
2. Update dependencies and configurations
3. Modernize deprecated APIs
4. Create deployment documentation
5. Generate a Pull Request with all changes

**This is where the magic happens!** 🎩✨

## 📝 Creating the Migration Issue

### Step 3.1: Create New Issue

1. Navigate to your repository
2. Click **"Issues"** tab
3. Click **"New Issue"**

### Step 3.2: Title and Description

**Title**: `Implement Migration - JDK 1.8 to JDK 17 and Spring 4.x to Spring Boot 3.x`

**Description Template**:

```markdown
@copilot Please implement the migration for this Java application based on the assessment in issue #[ASSESSMENT_ISSUE_NUMBER].

## Migration Summary

Based on the assessment, implement a complete migration from:

**Current State**:
- JDK 1.8
- Spring Boot 2.7.18 (last 2.x version)
- javax.* packages
- Hibernate 4.x
- Log4j 1.x
- WAR deployment

**Target State**:
- JDK 17 LTS
- Spring Boot 3.x (with Spring Framework 6.x)
- jakarta.* packages
- Hibernate 6.x (via Spring Boot)
- SLF4J + Logback
- Executable JAR

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Core Migration Tasks

#### Dependencies (pom.xml)
- [ ] Update Maven compiler source/target to Java 17
- [ ] Migrate to Spring Boot 3.x parent POM
- [ ] Add Spring Boot Starter dependencies
- [ ] Update Hibernate version (managed by Spring Boot)
- [ ] Replace Log4j with SLF4J/Logback
- [ ] Update Commons Lang to 3.x
- [ ] Remove servlet API dependency (provided by Spring Boot)
- [ ] Update Jackson version
- [ ] Add Spring Boot Maven plugin

#### Package Migrations
- [ ] javax.persistence.* → jakarta.persistence.*
- [ ] javax.validation.* → jakarta.validation.*
- [ ] javax.servlet.* → jakarta.servlet.*
- [ ] javax.transaction.* → jakarta.transaction.*

#### Code Modernization
- [ ] java.util.Date → java.time.LocalDateTime
- [ ] java.util.Calendar → java.time APIs
- [ ] SimpleDateFormat → DateTimeFormatter
- [ ] Field injection → Constructor injection
- [ ] @Controller + @ResponseBody → @RestController
- [ ] Remove deprecated primitive wrapper constructors
- [ ] Remove finalize() methods
- [ ] Update Hibernate-specific annotations

#### Configuration Migration
- [ ] Remove web.xml
- [ ] Remove applicationContext.xml
- [ ] Remove dispatcher-servlet.xml
- [ ] Create Spring Boot application class with @SpringBootApplication
- [ ] Create application.properties or application.yml
- [ ] Configure H2 database in Spring Boot style
- [ ] Enable scheduling with @EnableScheduling

#### Logging Migration
- [ ] Remove log4j.properties
- [ ] Update Logger imports to SLF4J
- [ ] Create logback-spring.xml (or use Spring Boot defaults)
- [ ] Update all log statements if needed

### 2. Azure Deployment - App Service Approach

**Selected Approach**: Azure App Service

Please implement:

#### Azure Developer CLI (azd) Configuration
- [ ] Create azure.yaml file for azd configuration
- [ ] Define the Spring Boot application as a service
- [ ] Configure Java 17 runtime
- [ ] Set up environment variables

#### Infrastructure as Code (Bicep)
- [ ] Create infra/main.bicep for resource group and module orchestration
- [ ] Create infra/resources.bicep for App Service Plan and App Service
- [ ] Configure Basic B1 tier (or higher) for alwaysOn support
- [ ] Set linuxFxVersion to 'JAVA|17-java17'
- [ ] Enable Application Insights for monitoring
- [ ] Configure health check endpoint (/api/messages)
- [ ] Set required app settings (APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING, PORT, SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE)

#### Environment Configuration
- [ ] Document required environment variables
- [ ] Configure H2 console access if needed
- [ ] Set up health check endpoints
- [ ] Enable alwaysOn for scheduled tasks

### 3. Critical Requirements

⚠️ **MUST PRESERVE FUNCTIONALITY**:

1. **Scheduled Task**
   - MUST run every 60 seconds (every minute)
   - MUST log message statistics
   - MUST use Spring Boot's @Scheduled with same timing
   - Verify this works in containerized environment

2. **REST API**
   - All CRUD endpoints must work identically
   - Response format should remain consistent
   - HTTP status codes preserved

3. **Database**
   - H2 in-memory database
   - Sample data must be loaded
   - Entity mappings preserved

### 4. Testing & Documentation

Please provide:

#### Local Testing Instructions
- [ ] How to build the application (`mvn clean package`)
- [ ] How to run locally (`java -jar` or `mvn spring-boot:run`)
- [ ] How to test endpoints (curl examples)
- [ ] How to verify scheduled task is running

#### Azure Developer CLI (azd) Testing
- [ ] How to initialize azd environment (`azd init`)
- [ ] How to deploy to Azure (`azd up`)
- [ ] How to test deployed application endpoints

#### Azure Deployment Guide
- [ ] Step-by-step Azure App Service deployment with azd
- [ ] Required Azure CLI and azd commands
- [ ] Configuration steps (azure.yaml, Bicep files)
- [ ] How to monitor with Application Insights
- [ ] How to view App Service logs
- [ ] Cost estimates for Basic B1 tier

#### Migration Summary Document
- [ ] List of files changed
- [ ] Key code transformations performed
- [ ] Configuration changes
- [ ] Breaking changes to be aware of
- [ ] Testing checklist

### 5. Code Quality

Please ensure:
- ✅ Follow Spring Boot 3.x best practices
- ✅ Use constructor injection consistently
- ✅ Apply modern Java idioms (var, enhanced switch, etc.)

   # Verify JDK 17 is installed
   java -version
   
   # Verify Maven
   mvn -version
   
   # Verify Azure CLI and azd
   az --version
   azd version
   ```

## 🔍 Monitoring Progress

### Check Issue Activity

Copilot may post updates like:

```markdown
I'm working on implementing this migration. I'll create a pull request with the changes shortly.
```

### Look for New Branches

Check your repository's branches:
```powershell
git fetch
git branch -r
```

Look for branches like:
- `copilot-migration-jdk17-springboot3`
- `copilot/migration-implementation`

### Watch for PR

You'll get a notification when the PR is created.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: No Response After 30 Minutes

**Try**:
1. Add a comment: `@copilot Status update please?`
2. Check Copilot service status
3. Create a new, simpler issue
4. Contact GitHub support if needed

### Issue: Response Says "I Can't Do This"

**Possible reasons**:
- Request too complex/broad
- Repository too large
- Technical limitations

**Solution**:
```markdown
@copilot Let's break this down. Please start with:

1. Update pom.xml to Spring Boot 3.x
2. Create Spring Boot application class
3. Migrate one controller as an example

We'll do the rest iteratively.
```

### Issue: Copilot Asks Questions

**Example**:
```markdown
Which specific Azure App Service tier should I target - Free, Basic, or Standard?
```

**Response**:
```markdown
@copilot Please target the Basic B1 tier for Azure App Service, as it supports alwaysOn for scheduled tasks while remaining cost-effective for this workshop scenario.
```
